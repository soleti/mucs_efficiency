###Measurement of the cosmic ray reconstruction efficiency in MicroBooNE using MuCS dataset

* `efficiency.py` - measure the data reconstruction efficiency using MuCS merged dataset
* `compare.py` - compare the data reconstruction efficiency with three different MuCS configurations
* `tracks_simple.py` - given theta and phi angles, draws the corresponding cosmic ray in 3D
* `mcc7_efficiency.py` - measure the Monte Carlo reconstructione efficiency using an MCC7 Monte Carlo file
* `purity.py` - measure the purity of a Monte Carlo MuCS dataset overlaid with cosmic rays with a given tolerance on the scatteering
* `mc_data.py` - plot data efficiency and MCC7 Monte Carlo efficiency on the same canvas
* `purity_efficiency_plot.py` - plot efficiency and purity as a function of the tolerance on the scattering
* `geomUtil.py` - geometry utility library for 3D line-plane intersections, cross-product, dot-product, etc.
